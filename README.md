## Diabetes Risk Factors Analysis Project

This project explores a public health dataset (from kaggle) to understand factors associated with diabetes, including demographic, behavioral, and health-related features. The goal is to derive actionable insights through data analysis and visualization.

---

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Identify patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes
- Use data analysis and visualization to uncover insights
- Communicate findings in a clear and actionable format

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains responses from a health survey with the following variables:

- **Diabetes_012**: Diabetes status (0 = No, 1 = Prediabetes, 2 = Diabetes)
- **HighBP, HighChol**: Presence of high blood pressure and cholesterol
- **CholCheck**: Whether cholesterol has been checked
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Smoker, HvyAlcoholConsump**: Smoking and alcohol behavior
- **Fruits, Veggies**: Daily consumption of fruits and vegetables
- **PhysActivity**: Physical activity in the last 30 days
- **GenHlth, MentHlth, PhysHlth**: Self-reported general, mental, and physical health
- **Age, Sex, Education, Income**: Demographic and socioeconomic information

---

## Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**

---

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Mapped categorical codes to descriptive labels (e.g., income groups, sex, age)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created healthy diet flag, and a binary diabetic label.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of diabetes across behaviors and demographics.
4. **Insights**: Identified high BMI, high cholesterol and high BP as risk factors.

## Key Insights

- General Health: Diabetic individuals report significantly poorer general health compared to non-diabetics.
- Lifestyle Factors: Diabetics show slightly lower healthy lifestyle scores, with reduced physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake.
- Risk Indicators: High blood pressure, high cholesterol, higher BMI and low physical activity are more prevalent among diabetic individuals.
- Diabetes Complications: Diabetics face higher rates of heart disease, stroke, and mobility difficulties.
- Age & Gender Trends: Diabetes is more common in older age groups. Females show higher prevalence in most age categories, except ages 65–69.
- Income: A higher number of diabetic cases appear in upper income groups.

---

## Recommendations
- Encourage Healthy Living: Promote physical activity and healthy diets, especially in high-risk groups like older individuals and women.
- Increase Preventive Screenings: Emphasize routine health checks for early detection and risk management.
- Gender-Focused Interventions: Tailor awareness and support programs considering that women may be disproportionately affected across most age groups.
- Investigate Income Disparities: Further explore why higher-income groups report more diabetes cases to better inform intervention strategies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data can be used to uncover critical public health patterns and support targeted interventions. It highlights my ability to clean, analyze, and communicate insights effectively using Python and Power BI.
